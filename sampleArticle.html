    <p>Feeling overwhelmed by your finances? Do you ever wonder where all your money goes? Budgeting can be a powerful tool to take control of your finances and achieve your financial goals.

      <li>**Wants (30%):** These are discretionary expenses that enhance your lifestyle, such as dining out, entertainment, subscriptions, hobbies, and clothing (beyond the basics).</li>
      <li>**Savings & Debt Repayment (20%):** This is crucial for building financial security. It includes savings goals like retirement, emergency fund, and down payment on a house, as well as extra payments towards debt to become debt-free faster.</li>
    </ul>
